    <h1 class="mt-5">Macro Virus</h1>
    <h2 class ="mt-5">Definition</h2>
    <p class="lead">A macro virus is a computer virus written in the same macro language used for software programs, including Microsoft Excel or word processors such as Microsoft Word. When a macro virus infects a software application, it causes a sequence of actions to begin automatically when the application is opened.</p>
    <h2 class="mt-5">How Macro Viruses work</h2>
    <p class="lead">Macro viruses work by embedding malicious code in the macros that are associated with documents, spreadsheets and other data files, causing the malicious programs to run as soon as the documents are opened. Typically, macro malware is transmitted through phishing emails containing malicious attachments. The macro virus spreads quickly as users share infected documents.

Once an infected macro is executed, it will typically infect every other document on a user's computer. Some macro viruses cause irregularities in text documents, such as inserting or deleting words. Other macro malware accesses email accounts and sends out copies of infected files to all of the users' contacts, who then open and access these files because they come from trusted sources.</p>


    <h2 class="mt-5">Prevention</h2>
    <p>Since macro viruses are usually spread in application files that have been shared across the internet by email, especially in phishing email, macro virus defenses include strategies for scanning inbound email attachments, preventing users from opening dubious files and preventing macros from running at all when documents are opened.

Some techniques for preventing the spread of macro viruses include:

Use a spam filter. The fewer phishing email messages users get in their inboxes, the less chance their computers will be infected by malware.
Use a strong antivirus program. Antivirus software will warn users when they attempt to download suspicious files or open harmful links.
Ensure that computers are running current software versions and that all security patches are installed.
Do not open attachments from unknown senders.
Do not open attachments in suspicious email messages, even when they appear to be from known senders.
Activate the macro security function on Microsoft Word and Excel, and exercise extreme caution about enabling macros.
Disable macro scripts entirely.</a>
<h2 class="mt-5">Example of a Macro Virus</h2>
<p> A now-classic example of a macro virus is the Melissa Virus from 1999. Opening an email containing a document infected with the virus caused the email to send itself to the first 50 addresses in the user’s contact list. The virus subsequently replicated at an extraordinarily fast rate.</p>
